        The HTTP server behind this HTTP URL does not host this website.
        Instead, it sends basic website code along with JavaScript. The JS sets
        up a tool called IPFS Service Worker Gateway in the user's browser and
        uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helia/verified-fetch to get IPFS blocks
        from content providers.

        CID hash verification and data assembly happens in the browser.
